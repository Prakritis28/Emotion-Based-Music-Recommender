# Emotion-Based-Music-Recommender

A real-time system that detects facial emotions using CNN and custom deep learning models trained on the FER-2013 dataset, and recommends music accordingly. The model classifies emotions like Happy, Sad, Angry, and Calm with ~70% accuracy. Based on the detected mood, it suggests suitable songs using a clustering-based approach and integrates with YT music for seamless playback. The project includes end-to-end implementation: data preprocessing, model training, real-time webcam input, emotion classification, and music recommendation.
